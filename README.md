<h3>CLI Notes CRUD Application</h3>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This was my first NodeJs project made in Nov,2021.But I decided to revisit this project and improve it. Previously I simply took input from the CLI using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs" target="_blank">yargs</a> and performed operations based on it but this required users to enter input in a definite pattern so I migrated from yargs to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer" target="_blank">Inquirer</a> where users can simply use the interactive CLI to perform desired operations.
